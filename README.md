# Docker Traffic Control

This is a fork of [lukaszlach/docker-tc](https://github.com/lukaszlach/docker-tc). There are two changes:
1. Removed the HTTP API.
2. Added support for specifying ingress and egress bandwidth limits separately.

**Docker Traffic Control** allows to set a rate limit on the container network and can emulate network conditions like delay, packet loss, duplication, and corrupt for the Docker containers, all that basing only on labels. **Project is written entirely in Bash** and is distributed as a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/lukaszlach/docker-tc/).

## Running

First run Docker Traffic Control daemon in Docker. It is best to run the container as `privileged` as it needs to enter other containers' network namespaces to set an egress bandwidth limit (if you aren't using this feature, the `NET_ADMIN` capability is enough). Additionally, it requires the host machine's `/var/run/docker.sock` to observe Docker events and query container details.

```bash
docker run -d \
    --name docker-tc \
    --network host \
    --pid host \
    --privileged \
    --restart always \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    ethanvdh/docker-tc
```

This repository contains `docker-compose.yml` file in root directory. You can use it instead of manually running `docker run` command. Newest version of image will be pulled automatically and the container will run in daemon mode.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethanvdh/docker-tc-simple.git
cd docker-tc-simple
docker-compose up -d
```

## Usage

After the daemon is up it scans all running containers and starts listening for `container:start` events triggered by Docker Engine. When a new container is up (also a new Swarm service) and contains `com.docker-tc.enabled` label set to `1`, Docker Traffic Control starts applying network traffic rules according to the rest of the labels from `com.docker-tc` namespace it finds.

Docker Traffic Control recognizes the following labels:

* `com.docker-tc.enabled` - when set to `1` the container network rules will be set automatically, any other value or if the label is not specified - the container will be ignored
*  `com.docker-tc.limit_ingress` - bandwidth or rate limit for traffic entering the container, accepts a floating point number, followed by a unit, or a percentage value of the device's speed (e.g. 70.5%). Following units are recognized:
    * `bit`, `kbit`, `mbit`, `gbit`, `tbit`
    * `bps`, `kbps`, `mbps`, `gbps`, `tbps`
    * to specify in IEC units, replace the SI prefix (k-, m-, g-, t-) with IEC prefix (ki-, mi-, gi- and ti-) respectively
* `com.docker-tc.limit_egress` - same as `limit_ingress` but for traffic leaving the container
* `com.docker-tc.delay` - length of time packets will be delayed, accepts a floating point number followed by an optional unit:
    * `s`, `sec`, `secs`
    * `ms`, `msec`, `msecs`
    * `us`, `usec`, `usecs` or a bare number
* `com.docker-tc.loss` - percentage loss probability to the packets outgoing from the chosen network interface
* `com.docker-tc.duplicate` - percentage value of network packets to be duplicated before queueing
* `com.docker-tc.corrupt` - emulation of random noise introducing an error in a random position for a chosen percent of packets

> Read the [tc command manual](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc.8.html) to get detailed information about parameter types and possible values.

Run the `busybox` container on custom network to create virtual network interface, specify all possible labels and try to `ping google.com` domain.

```bash
docker network create test-net
docker run -it \
	--net test-net \
	--label "com.docker-tc.enabled=1" \
	--label "com.docker-tc.limit=1mbps" \
	--label "com.docker-tc.delay=100ms" \
	--label "com.docker-tc.loss=50%" \
	--label "com.docker-tc.duplicate=50%" \
	--label "com.docker-tc.corrupt=10%" \
	busybox \
	ping google.com
```

You should see output similar to shown below, `ping` correctly reports duplicates, packets are delayed and some of them lost.

## Supported platforms

Docker Traffic Control only works on Linux distributions like Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS or Fedora.

* MacOS - not supported due to lack of host network mode support
* Windows - not supported due to separate network stack between Linux and Windows containers
